## Phase 2: Local Dominance (Weeks 5-12)
### "Own San Diego"

#### 2.1 Local SEO - The 5,000 Page Strategy

Build programmatic landing pages targeting every San Diego neighborhood and nearby city:

**Page Examples:**
- `/sourdough-bread-san-diego`
- `/cake-pops-la-mesa`

- "artisan bakery [city]"
- "best sourdough san diego"

**Technical Approach:**
- Create template page
- Generate 50-100 location pages automatically
- Each page has unique content about that area
- Internal linking structure
- Schema markup for local business

#### 2.2 Social Media Foundation

**Instagram Strategy:**
- Post 3-4x/week (bread photos, behind-the-scenes, cake pop designs)
- Use local hashtags (#sandiegofood #sandiegobakery #sdfoodies)
- Stories showing the baking process
- Reels of satisfying bread cutting/cake pop dipping

**Content Calendar:**
| Day | Content Type |
|-----|-------------|
| Mon | Fresh bake photo |
| Wed | Behind-the-scenes / process |

3. **Yelp** - Claim listing, respond to reviews
4. **Local food bloggers** - Send free samples for reviews
5. **Farmer's markets** - Consider a booth (good for visibility + cash flow)

**Paid Tactics (when ready):**

2. **Google Ads** - "cake pops san diego" type keywords
3. **Nextdoor Ads** - Hyper-local, relatively cheap

**Cost:** $0-300/month depending on ad spend  
**Expected Result:** 2-5x increase in local orders

## Phase 4: Scale & Ship (Months 4-6+)
### "Go National"

#### 4.1 Shipping Infrastructure

**Frozen Sourdough Model:**
Many successful bakeries ship frozen bread that customers bake at home:
- Bread is par-baked (80% done)
- Flash frozen
- Ships in insulated box with ice packs
- Customer finishes in home oven (10-15 min)
- Arrives "fresh from the oven"

**Shipping Partners:**
- ShipBob (fulfillment)
- Goldbelly (artisan food marketplace - they handle everything)
- Direct shipping via UPS/FedEx with insulated packaging

**Packaging Costs (estimated):**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Insulated box | $3-5 |
| Ice packs | $1-2 |
| Packaging materials | $1-2 |
| Shipping (2-day) | $15-25 |

**Minimum viable shipping price:** ~$35-40 for a loaf (includes product + shipping + margin)

#### 4.2 National Landing Pages

Build location pages for every major city:
- `/sourdough-bread-delivery-los-angeles`
- `/artisan-bread-shipped-new-york`
- `/best-sourdough-online-chicago`

**Scale:** 200-500 city pages targeting "sourdough delivery [city]" searches

#### 4.3 Subscription Model

**"Bread Club" Subscription:**
- Monthly delivery of fresh/frozen sourdough
- $45-65/month depending on frequency
- Predictable revenue
- Loyal customer base

**Example Tiers:**
| Tier | Contents | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Starter | 1 loaf/month | $45 |
| Baker | 2 loaves/month | $75 |
| Family | 4 loaves/month | $125 |
